# animalcrossingpedia

This Code Louisville project is an Animal Crossing critterpedia. 
It pulls from the Animal Crossing New Horizon's API, http://acnhapi.com/. 
Users are presented with a list of the critters that can be caught and donated in the game. 
The users can add or remove critters to their caught or donated list and this will store to their local storage.

Users can sort the critters to show every critter or just the ones that are currently available to them.
