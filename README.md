# animalcrossingpedia

This Code Louisville project is an Animal Crossing critterpedia. 

It pulls from the Animal Crossing New Horizon's API, http://acnhapi.com/. 
Users are presented with a list of the critters that can be caught and donated in the game. 
Users can click on the info buttons to see additional information for each of the critters like price and their museum phrase.
The users can add critters to their caught or donated list.
Once they have critters in either of these lists they can download a text file with the names of those critters listed
